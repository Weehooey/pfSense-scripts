## install-qemu-guest-agent.sh

If you are using pfSense in Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE), running this script from the pfSense command line will install the QEMU guest agent and set it to run on boot.


### Enable QEMU Guest Agent in Proxmox VE

When creating your pfSense virtual machine (VM), set Options > QEMU Guest Agent to `enabled` when you create your VM.

If you enable the QEMU Guest Agent while the VM is running, you will need to reboot it.


### Usage

1. Log into the pfSense command line as `root`
2. Run `curl -LJO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Weehooey/pfSense-scripts/main/install-qemu-guest-agent.sh`
3. READ THE DOWNLOADED FILE! You should never blindly run scripts from the internet.
4. Make the file executable `chmod +x install-qemu-guest-agent.sh`
5. Run the installation script `./install-qemu-guest-agent.sh`
6. You should now see the IP addresses for the interfaces on the VMs summary page (click the More button to see all of them)
